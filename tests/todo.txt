#TODO - write tests

This project has been pretty experimental.  Without a clear picture of where it was going testing everything didn't really make sense.  Here are some corners that should be tested once the architecture solidifies.

# Config reader
## Throw heredocs at it.  Should be a way to override the hardcoded rc file
## Make sure a useful error shows up when an invalid plugin is called
## Ditto for invalid options
## Make sure it reads strings and blocks
# Individual plugins
## No idea how to test long running ones, aside from timecop and checking output
## Script runner may not have to check respawn, just that a script does its thing
## Starrt some scripts with relatively prime respawns.  Ignore the first n.  Compare the rest determinisitcally.  For overengineering bonus points, set those respawns programatically.
